Both tests must be ordered. In co-testing, both cytology and HPV are ordered. HPV testing based on Pap smear results is considered reflex testing and does not count towards the HPV co-testing HEDIS measure. # Lab results that explicitly state the sample was inadequate or that 'no cervical cells were present' do not count; this is not considered appropriate screening. ?#Biopsies do not count because they are diagnostic and therapeutic only and are not valid for primary cervical cancer screening. Exclusion Documentation must include a note indicating a hysterectomy with no residual cervix by December 31St of the measurement year. # Complete, Total or Radical abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy meets criteria for hysterectomy with no residual cervix. # Documentation of a Vaginal Pap Smear in conjunction with documentation of Hysterectomy meets exclusion criteria. # Documentation of hysterectomy in combination with documentation that the patient no longer needs pap testing/cervical cancer screening # Documentation of hysterectomy alone does not meet criteria because it does not indicate that the cervix was removed.",

Protein loss in the urine due to damage to the glomeruli may become massive, and cause a low serum albumin with resulting generalized body swelling (edema) and result in the nephrotic syndrome.\r\n\r\nDiabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of ESKD and is a serious complication and affects around one-quarter of adult diabetics in the United States. Affected individuals with end-stage kidney disease often require hemodialysis and eventually kidney transplantation to replace the failed kidney function. Diabetic nephropathy is associated with an increased risk of death in general, particularly from cardiovascular disease.\r\n\r\nThe goals of treatment are to slow the progression of kidney damage and control related complications. The main treatment, once proteinuria is established, is ACE inhibitor medications, which usually reduce proteinuria levels and slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Other issues that are important in the management of this condition include control of high blood pressure and blood sugar levels (see diabetes management), as well as the reduction of dietary salt intake",
